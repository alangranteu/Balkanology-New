<h2>Republic of Macedonia | Links</h2>

<p>The sites listed on this page are specifically about Macedonia. Many of the more general sites listed in the <a href="../overview/links.html" title="Websites about the Balkan region">Overview of the Balkans</a> are also useful for planning a trip to Macedonia.</p>

<p>Macedonia seems to have a particularly high number of sites that look useful at first glance but on close inspection turn out not to have been maintained for several years. Don't assume any online information is still valid unless a site shows some evidence of recent activity.</p>

<h3>Travel Information</h3>

<ul class="linklist">
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.exploringmacedonia.com">Exploring Macedonia</a></h4>
<p>Macedonia's "Official Tourism Portal" fairly has the usual mixture of destinations and accommodation. The section on bus travel confirms something that many visitors to the Balkans notice: some locals have "an irrational, all-pervasive fear of fresh air". Some hotels can be booked online through the site (I've tried this and it does work - eventually).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://inyourpocket.com/macedonia">Skopje In Your Pocket</a></h4>
<p>This Skopje guide was launched in autumn 2006 and follows the format of IYP's successful guides to other Eastern European cities. Whether you want to find the best places to eat or the most, ahem, striking examples of 1970's architecture, you can get help in these pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">WikiTravel Macedonia</a></h4>
<p>One of the better WikiTravel sites about the Balkans, with good coverage of Skopje in particular and quite a lot of detail on a number of other locations including Ohrid, Bitola, and Prilep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.skopjeonline.com.mk/">Skopje Online</a></h4>
<p>Find out where to go, eat, see, and stay in Macedonia's capital. The train timetable in the Latin alphabet could be a handy feature for those who can't read the Macedonian Railways site (see below), but last time I checked it was out of date.</p>
</li>
<!-- Broken link Jan 2009
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.ohrid.com.mk/">City of Ohrid</a></h4>
<p>A guide to the city of Ohrid and the rest of the Lake Ohrid region. I'm not sure if it has been updated recently, but there is a lot of information here - check the "Heritage Trails" section for a wide range of suggested places to visit away from the beaten track.</p>
</li> -->
<li>
<h4><a href="http://adventureguidemacedonia.com/joomla/index.php">Adventure Guide Macedonia</a>
<br/><a href="http://www.gomacedonia.com">Go	 Macedonia</a></h4>
<p>Outdoor exploration in Macedonia, from one-day excursions to longer tours. Even if you aren't planning on joining a tour, you may find some useful tips about where to visit in the detailed itineraries on these sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transport and Practicalities</h3>
<ul class="linklist">
<li>
<h4><a id="rail" href="http://www.mz.com.mk/">Macedonian Railways</a></h4>
<p>In Macedonian only the last time I checked - the English version has been "under construction" for years.  Think of it as a chance to practice reading the Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.sas.com.mk/">Skopje Bus Station</a></h4>
<p>Timetable and ticket prices for Skopje's main bus station. There used to be an English version of the site, but as of January 2009 it seems to have disappeared - another chance to practice your Cyrillic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.ohrid.gov.mk/index.asp?NovostiID=112">Ohrid Bus Timetable</a></h4>
<p>In Macedonian only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.jsp.com.mk/index_en.php?idJazik=2">JSP - Skopje City Transport</a></h4>
<p>Considering the lack of information on the ground, JSP's web site is surprisingly informative, with maps, timetables and fare details for urban and suburban lines. Useful for planning trips to outlying areas such as Lake Matka. There is even a touch of lyricism: "The pulse of JSP SKOPJE wakes up the industrial capacities, with us the first school classes begin, the night shifts end".</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.airports.com.mk/">Skopje and Ohrid airports</a>
<br/><a href="http://www.mat.com.mk/">Air Macedonia</a></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.macedonianembassy.org.uk/">The Macedonian Embassy in the U.K.</a></h4>
<p>As well as the usual visa information, the Embassy provides plenty of links to other sites about Macedonia in the "Tourism" and "Links" section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.mfa.gov.mk/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a></h4>
<p>Entry requirements for visitors are outlined under "Consular Services, Information for Foreigners".</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<ul class="linklist">
<li>
<h4><a href="http://faq.macedonia.org">Macedonia FAQ</a></h4>
<p>Information about many aspects of Macedonian history and culture. There is a page about the <a href="http://faq.macedonia.org/language/">Macedonian Cyrillic Alphabet</a>, and the Travel section has detailed descriptions and photos of many places in Macedonia. A word of warning: as far as I can tell the site hasn't been updated since about 2003.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.mia.com.mk/">Macedonian Information Agency</a></h4>
<p>The latest news from Macedonia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.bitola.de/eng-index.htm">Bitola Babam Bitola</a></h4>
<p>This neat site is a tribute to Macedonia's second largest city, with historical background and a collection of songs paying tribute to the beauty of Bitola (and its women). There is also some practical information such as bus schedules.</p>

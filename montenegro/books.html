<h4><span class="bookname">Montenegro - The Bradt Travel Guide</span> &nbsp;(5th edition published March 2015) - Annalise Rellie</h4>
<p>Earlier editions of this guide seemed to be aimed at a rather different market than Bradt's other guides to the region, lacking some of the practical information required by independent travellers. I've been told that the current edition contains some improvements; one notable addition is a section on excursions outside Montenegro's borders.</p>

<h4><span class="bookname">The Mountains of Montenegro - Cicerone Guide</span> &nbsp;(2nd edition published July 2015) - Rudolf Abraham</h4>
<p>Montenegro has great potential for walking and trekking, but until recently it has been frustratingly different to find information in English about the country's mountains. This guide aims to fill the gap, with descriptions of hiking trails in Durmitor, Orjen, Prokletije, and a number of other mountain ranges. There are detailed descriptions of 17 main routes, with additional information on other possibilities.</p>

<h3><a id="general"></a>Background Reading</h3>

<p>My reading so far hasn't included any books specifically about Montenegro, but several of the works on Balkan history listed in the <a title="Books about the Balkans (General)" href= "../overview/books2.html">Overview</a> may be of interest. There are reasonably substantial sections on Montenegro in several books dealing with the former <a title="Books about the Balkans (Yugoslavia)" href= "../overview/books2.html#yugo">Yugoslavia</a>, including <a title="Books about the Balkans (General)" href="../overview/books2.html#murphy"><span class="bookname">Through the Embers of Chaos</span></a> and  <a title="Books about the Balkans (General)" href="../overview/books2.html#west"><span class="bookname">Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</span></a>. <a title="Books about the Balkans (General)" href="../overview/books2.html#jezernik"><span class="bookname">Wild Europe</span></a> includes interesting material about the romantic portrayal of the Montenegrins by some travellers.</p>

<h2>Kosovo | Books</h2>

<h3>Travel Guides</h3>

<p>Very short descriptions of Kosovo (i.e. shorter than 12 pages) appear in three of Lonely Planet's regional guides listed in the <a title="Books about the Balkan region" href="../overview/books.html">Overview</a> section: <a title="Books about the Balkan region" href="../overview/books.html#lp_sh">Europe on a Shoestring</a>, <a title="Books about the Balkan region" href="../overview/books.html#lp_ee">Eastern Europe</a>, and <a title="Books about the Balkan region" href="../overview/books.html#lp_see">Southeastern Europe</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="bookname">Kosovo - The Bradt Guide</span> &nbsp;(Verena Kraus and Gail Warrander - 2nd edition published November 2010)</h4>
<p>The only English-language guidebook dedicated entirely to Kosovo. I used this when travelling around Kosovo in 2015 and found it very useful. Due to the passage of time some information (particularly about hotels and restaurants) has naturally become dated, but I would still recommend this book to anyone visiting Kosovo for more than a few days.</p>

<h4><span class="bookname">Blue Guide: Albania and Kosovo</span> &nbsp;(3rd edition published March 2001) - James Pettifer</h4>
<p>Much has changed in Albania and Kosovo since the Blue Guide was published, so many of the practical details have inevitably become outdated. Even so, its outstanding level of details makes it worth tracking down a second-hand copy if you are planning to explore the Albanian-speaking parts of the Balkans in depth. A 60-page chapter on Kosovo is included.</p>

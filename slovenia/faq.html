<a id="a1"></a><h4>What is the best way to get to Bled and Bohinj?</h4>
<p><strong>Bled</strong> is served by hourly <strong>buses</strong> from Ljubljana via Kranj and Lesce; the journey time is less than 1.5 hours. Lesce, a small town about 5km from Bled, has a <strong>train</strong> station on the fairly busy Ljubljana-Jesenice line (which continues to Villach in Austria) - in fact the station is sometimes rather misleadingly known as "Bled-Lesce". Lesce there are one or two buses an hour to Bled. If you are arriving from Ljubljana, it's simpler just to get the bus.</p>
<p>There is a train station called Bled Jezero overlooking the lake; it is on the much less busy (but scenic) Jesenice-Most na So&#x010D;i line. It is on the opposite side of the lake to Bled town and most accommodation - a pleasant half-hour stroll if you don't have bags, a bit of a trudge if you do.</p>
<p>Most of the Ljubljana-Bled buses continue to <strong>Lake Bohinj</strong>, a 40 minute journey. They stop at the eastern end of the lake (Rib&#x010D;ev Laz, the largest concentration of accommodation in the Bohinj area) and continue to Ukanc at the western end, which is convenient if you want to visit the Savica waterfall or the Vogel cable car. These two stops are shown on timetables as "Bohinj Jezero" and "Bohinj Zlatorog" respectively. As with Bled, trains are generally less convenient. The Jesenice-Most na So&#x010D;i line  has a stop at Bohinjska Bistrica, several kilometres east of the lake; you can pick up the Bled-Bohinj buses there.</p>
<p>Timetables for all of these train and bus journeys can be checked online at the sites listed in the <a href="links.html#transport" title="Websites about Slovenia">Slovenia Links</a> page. As always in Slovenia, you should check the precise date on which your intend to travel, as schedules can change quite a lot depending on the day of the week and time of year.</p>

<a id="a2"></a><h4>Is it possible to get to &#x0160;kocjan Caves by public transport?</h4>
<p>Trains and buses go to the small and rather sleepy village of <strong>Diva&#x010d;a</strong> about 4km from from the caves - the trip takes about 1.5 hours from Ljubljana. In the other direction you can reach Diva&#x010d;a from Koper.
Until quite recently there was no public transport between Diva&#x010d;a and the caves. Fortunately a shuttle bus (free for train ticket holders) now links the train station and the caves four times a day - see the timetable on the <a href="http://www.slo-zeleznice.si/en/passengers/additional-offers/bus-transportation#skocjan/">Slovenian Railways</a> website.</p> 
<p>You can also reach the caves on foot in about 40 minutes by following a path signposted to <i>Park &#x0160;kocjanske Jame</i> (don't be distracted by signs aimed at motorists). The first part of the trail is slightly tricky to follow but once you reach the park surrounding the cave it's a very pleasant walk. There is a sketch map on the <a title="Websites about Slovenia" href="../slovenia/links.html#skocjan">&#x0160;kocjan Caves</a> website, and you may be able to get a map from train station staff.</p>

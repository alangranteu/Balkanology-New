The Albanian low-cost airline <a href="http://www.belleair.it/default.aspx?lang=en">Belle Air</a> has recently started operating direct flights from London Stansted to Tirana twice weekly (Thursdays and Sundays). There are now three airlines offering flights from London to Tirana - Albanian Airlines already flies from Stansted, while British Airways flies from Gatwick.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I was particularly impressed by <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/greece/article_thessaloniki.html" title="Travel information about Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, which now has a page of its own. I've also added pages about the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/greece/article_greece_macedonia.html" title="Travel information about the province of Macedonia in Greece">Province of Macedonia</a> and the monasteries of <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/greece/article_meteora.html" title="Travel information about Meteora">Meteora</a>.

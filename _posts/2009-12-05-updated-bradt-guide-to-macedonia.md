title: Updated Bradt Guide to Macedonia
---

The third edition of the Bradt Guide to Macedonia has recently been published. Like the first two editions the updated guide was written by Thammy Evans, and it remains the only English-language guidebook dedicated entirely to the Republic of Macedonia. This edition is about 50 pages longer than its predecessor, and the publishers say that it includes "new material on battlefields and historical figures, as well as updated information on outdoor pursuits, folk festivals, wine, archaeology â€“ and, of course, Macedonia's fast-improving hotels, restaurants and bars".<br />

---

Several UK newspapers have published articles about <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/montenegro/index.html">Montenegro</a> in the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1339972/Montenegro-s-spotless-beaches-wild-wolves-Corner-Europe-untamed-tourism.html">The Mail</a> describes a family driving holiday based mainly on the Adriatic coast, with an excursion inland to Durmitor National Park.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/serbiaandmontenegro/8250020/Montenegro-hiking-to-the-heights-of-satisfaction.html">The Telegraph's</a> writer also spent a few days on the Adriatic before heading inland, in this case to hike in the relatively little-known Komovi Mountains.<br />
<br />
Finally, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/step-carefully-as-you-walk-on-the-wild-side-2185597.html">the Independent's</a> correspondent also combined the coast and the interior on an eventful family holiday.

Today's Guardian looks at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/23/bulgaria.budget">Veliko Turnovo</a>, which it describes as "Bulgaria's best kept secret". I have no argument with most of the content of the article, but I think the "best kept secret" line is misleading and likely to lead to disappointment. I like Veliko Turnovo and often recommend that people visit it, but I would never describe it as a "hidden treasure". It may not attract the mass-market tourism of the Black Sea coast or the ski resorts, but it's still quite a touristy place.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/bulgaria4"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/46842953/small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 120px;" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://balkanology.com/bulgaria/article_veliko_tarnovo.html">More about Veliko Turnovo on Balkanology </a>

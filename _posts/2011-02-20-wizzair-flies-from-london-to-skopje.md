title: Wizzair flies from London to Skopje
---

Skopje is currently one of very few European capital cities with no direct scheduled flights to the United Kingdom. That's about to change, as <a href="http://wizzair.com/flights/London-Luton/Skopje/">Wizzair</a> has announced that they will fly from Skopje to London Luton starting on June 20th. There will be three return flights weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) until the end of September. It also appears that the route will continue into the winter, with the Wizzair site currently showing flights scheduled on Thursdays and Sundays from October.

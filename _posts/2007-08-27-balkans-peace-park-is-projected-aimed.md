title: Balkans Peace Park nominated for tourism award
---

The Balkans Peace Park is a project aimed at creating a transnational park in the remote mountain region where the borders of Montenegro, Kosovo, and Albania come together.<br /><br />The project has recently been nominated for the British Guild of Travel Writers annual Tourism Awards, in the category "best overseas tourism project". One of the criteria for the prize is that the project should "allow for interested travellers to explores landscapes, communities and cultures which might otherwise be off limits" - which seems to be a perfect description of the Peace Park.<br /><br />A shortlist of three contenders will be chosen on 12 September, with the winner to be announced on 11 November. Best wishes from Balkanology to everyone involved.<br /><br /><a href="https://balkanspeacepark.org/tourism%20award%20announcement.pdf">More about the nomination</a> (PDF file)<br /><a href="https://balkanspeacepark.org/">More about the Balkan Peace Park Project</a>

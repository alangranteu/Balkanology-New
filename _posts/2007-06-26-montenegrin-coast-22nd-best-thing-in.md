Rough Guides are celebrating their 25th anniversary by publishing "25s", a series of 25 books, each of which suggest 25 inspirational travel experiences. <br /><br />Now they are have chosen the "ultimate" experience from each of the 25 books. The chosen candidate to represent Eastern Europe is the <a href="http://25s.roughguides.com/experience/Eastern-Europe.aspx">coast of Montenegro</a> - no arguments from me there. Rough Guides are <a href="http://25s.roughguides.com/">asking for votes</a> for the "ultimate ultimate" experience. At the moment Montenegro is languishing in 22nd place, but I confidently expect the votes of Balkanology's readership to send it surging up the chart to ... well, perhaps to 21st place.

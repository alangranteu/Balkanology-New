title: An interactive map of the Balkans
---

<a href="http://www.esiweb.org/">European Stability Initiative (ESI)</a> is a research institute working in Southeast Europe. There is a wealth of material on their web site for anyone looking for some in-depth analysis of  issues currently facing the Balkans.<br /><br />Recently they added a new feature to the site. "<a href="http://www.esiweb.org/picturestories/neg/index.htm">Return to Europe: A Balkan Journey"</a> is an interactive map of the Balkans that aims to lead the visitor on a journey of discovery through the region. There are some fascinating quotations from past visitors - did you know that the streets of Sarajevo were once plied by double-decker London buses?<br /><br />By the way, if you think some of the photos look familiar - yes, they're mine.

title: Escape from British tourists in the Balkans
---

The Independent recently published a list of the "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-ten-best-destinations-to-escape-the-british-crowds-this-summer-1763616.html">Ten best destinations to escape the British crowds this summer</a>". Not necessarily free of tourist crowds in general, it seems - just British crowds. Destinations in Southeast Europe make up half the list: Sarajevo, Montenegro, Slovenia, the Romanian Black Sea coast, and (rather surprisingly) Croatia. Nice to see Balkanology.com getting a mention on the Sarajevo page, even if they didn't quite get the spelling right.<br /><br />Balkan destinations have also popped up in several of the Independent's other "Ten best" features. Dubrovnik gets a mention as one of the "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-ten-best-city-beach-breaks-1763788.html">Ten best city beach breaks</a>". Croatian's Motovun Film Festival features as one of the "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-best-alternative-festivals-1763014.html">Best alternative festivals</a>" (Motovun is in Istria, not Central Croatia as stated in the article). And Romania is one of the "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-ten-best-harry-potter-landmarks-1744670.html">Best Harry Potter landmarks</a>". Something to do with dragons, apparently.

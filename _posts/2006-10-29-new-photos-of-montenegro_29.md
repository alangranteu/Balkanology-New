title: New photos of Montenegro
---

I have been busy expanding my <a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/montenegro">Montenegro Galleries</a> with photos taken on my most recent visit in September. <br /><br />Most of the new photos are from <a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/montenegro1">Durmitor National Park</a> in the mountains of northern Montenegro. This is one of the most impressive places I have seen on my travels. The wonderful hiking trails were almost deserted in early September, apart from a few Czech and Polish visitors. Although the mountains appear rather jagged and forbidding at first glance, many of them have relatively smooth slopes on one side. Combined with the high altitude of the resort of &#x017d;abljak, this means that it is possible to get to many of the higher peaks in a few hours of surprisingly easy walking. Of course this was in September when there is no snow cover. I had 5 days of clear weather, which apparently is freakishly lucky. (I paid for this luck when I visited Bohinj in Slovenia later in my trip - it rained for three days).<br /><br />As well as Durmitor, there are also some new photos of Kotor, Ulcinj, and Stari Bar. It was nice to be actually able to get into Stari Bar - on a previous off-season visit I found the place locked.

title: On the way to Albania... and beyond
---

Over the last few days my plans for another extended trip around the Balkans have started to come together. This time I will be concentrating on the Western Balkans. Next week I will finally visit Albania, the one country in the region that I haven't yet seen. In September I will continue to Montenegro, Serbia, and possibly Macedonia.<br /><br />Once I return home in October I will get busy uploading new photos and updating Balkanology with proper coverage of Albania (at last) and of whichever other areas I get to visit. In the meantime, though, there won't be any updates to the site.

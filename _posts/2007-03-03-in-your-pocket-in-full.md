The <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com">In Your Pocket</a> people have recently started to make full versions of their excellent city guides available for <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/static/download/downloads_main.html">free download</a>. They have been providing condensed "instant guides" in this way for some time, but this new development means that you can get your hands on all the information on the web site in a convenenient format. <br /><br />Balkan cities for which full downloads are available currently include Tirana, Shkodra, Skopke, Pristina, and Bucharest. Instant guides are also available for Dubrovnik, Osijek, Rijeka, Sofia, and Zagreb.

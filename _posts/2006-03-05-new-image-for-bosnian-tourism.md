The <a href="http://www.bhtourism.ba/eng/">Tourist Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> has recently overhauled its website. As well as a significant improvement in the information available, there is another sign of progress: for the first time information about destinations in Republika Srpska is included. The site has a good mix of attractive photos and practical information, and is well worth a look if you are thinking of visiting BiH.

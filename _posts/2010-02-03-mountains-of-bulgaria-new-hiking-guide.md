Keen hikers hoping to explore Bulgaria's mountain ranges may be interested in a new guidebook that has just been published by Cicerone. "Walking in Bulgaria's National Parks" describes 12 treks in the Pirin, Rila, and Central Balkan national parks, with detailed information about the plant and animal life likely to be encountered along the way. <br />
<br />
Julian Perry, the book's author, also maintains a blog about <a href="http://hiking-trekking-bulgaria.blogspot.com/">Hiking in Bulgaria</a>, where he has recently been keeping readers up to date on the exceptionally icy weather that has gripped the region.<br />

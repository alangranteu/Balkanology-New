title: Easyjet flies from London Gatwick to Dubrovnik
---

Earlier this month Easyjet <a href="http://www.easyjet.com/EN/News/new_routes_gatwick_larnaca_naples_dubrovnik_santor.html">announced</a> the launch of a new route from London Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Flights will start on 1st May 2009 and will operate four times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday). <br /><br />At the time of writing one-way fares of Â£34 including taxes are available on a variety of dates in May and June. Not surprisingly, cheap fares in July and August are a little harder to come by, but early bookers should still be able to find some reasonable deals.

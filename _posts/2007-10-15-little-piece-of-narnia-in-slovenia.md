title: A little piece of Narnia in Slovenia

The next instalment in Disney's Narnia series, <span style="font-style: italic;">Prince Caspian</span>, is due for release in 2008. Some of the battle scenes were filmed earlier this year on location in the So&amp;x10da Valley in western Slovenia. This has prompted a lengthy article in yesterday's <a href="http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/destinations/europe/article2642843.ece">Sunday Times</a>. <br /><br />The write describes the So&amp;x10da as a "beautiful, unknown valley". Unknown? Hasn't he heard of Balkanology? The valley is a firm favourite of mine and has had its <a href="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/article_soca_valley.html">own page</a> on the site for some time. That aside, the article is a useful survey of the many and varied attractions of the valley, from something called "hydrospeeding" to tours of the battle sites - from World War One, not the Disney film.<br /><br /><a href="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0275.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0275.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 180px;" /></a><br /><a href="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0255.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0255.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 147px;" /></a><br /><a href="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0427.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://balkanology.com/slovenia/images/slovenia200509_pict0427.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 122px;" /></a>

Formal bus stations and printed or online timetables are almost unknown in Albania, so getting hold of timetable information can be tricky. The recently created website "<a href="http://www.matinic.us/albania/furgon.php">Albania Minibus Schedules</a>" is a very useful list of bus and furgon (minibus) routes and timetables. Naturally it is entirely unofficial, but it's very useful for getting a reasonable idea of frequencies and departure points on particular routes. The page is editable, so if you have been in Albania recently you can contribute with up to date information.

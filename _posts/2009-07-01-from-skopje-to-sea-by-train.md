The "Balkan Travellers" website <a href="https://balkantravellers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1305">reports</a> that two summer-only train services Skopje to the seaside beging operating this week. A daily overnight service from Skopje to Bar on Montenegro's Adriatic coast will run until 31 August, while a train to Varna on Bulgaria's Black Sea will run on Saturdays only until 4 September. For those of you puzzling over rail maps of Southeast Europe: both trains travel via Ni≈° in Serbia.

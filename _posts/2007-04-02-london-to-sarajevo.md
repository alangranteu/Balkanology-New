Last week British Airways began operating direct flights to Sarajevo for the first time. Flights from London Gatwick will leave on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. The cheapest fare I could find in a quick test was Â£158 including taxes.<br /><br />Following on from last year's introduction of London-Tirana flights, I believe this leaves Skopje as the only Balkan capital not served by direct flights from London - BA does list it as a destination, but it's a codeshare with Malev and involves a change in Budapest. It's probably quicker to fly to Pristina, a quick cross-border trip away from Skopje.<br /><br />Returning to Bosnia, the Christian Science Monitor this week published an interesting article called <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0329/p13s01-woeu.html">Come See the Pyramids... in Bosnia?</a>, looking at the growing pains of the Bosnian tourist industry - including the somewhat dubious promotion of the (in)famous Visoko Pyramid.

title: Flights from Liverpool to Dubrovnik ... and more
---

Following its announcement of a new route from London Gatwick to Dubrovnik last month, budget airline <a href="http://www.easyjet.com/EN/News/14_new_routes_cheap_flights_across_europe.html">Easyjet</a> yesterday launched another connection from England to the southern Croatian airport. Flights from Liverpool to Dubrovnik will operate three times weekly (Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday) from early June. <br /><br />It seems that the Dalmatian coast will be busy with Easyjet customers in summer 2009. As well as the new UK routes, the airline will fly to Dubrovnik three times weekly from Berlin and twice weekly from Geneva.<br /><br />Easyjet is also making it easier to reach Greece from the English regions: over the summer they will fly twice weekly from both Bristol and Manchester to Corfu, and from Manchester to Athens.

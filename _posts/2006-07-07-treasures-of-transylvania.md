Transylvania is one of my favourite corners of Europe, but until now I hadn't got around to writing much about it for Balkanology. I've put that right with two new pages, one about <a href="https://balkanology.com/romania/article_brasov.html">Brasov</a> and the surrounding area, the other about <a href="https://balkanology.com/romania/article_transylvania.html">Sibiu, Cluj, and Sighisoara</a>.

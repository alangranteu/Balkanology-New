title: Snowboarding in the Balkans
---

A recent article in <i>The Guardian</i>, "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/jan/04/balkans-skiing-snowboarding-resorts">Boarding the Balkan Bloc</a>", looks at the snowboarding opportunities on offer in a number of ski resorts in the Western Balkans. Among the destinations covered are Kapaonik (Serbia), Popova Shapka (Macedonia), Kola≈°in (Montenegro), and Jahorina (Bosnia). The writer's overall impression of snowboarding in the region: "rugged mountains; masses of deep, powdery, snow; tree runs from heaven; zero lift queues; friendly locals; low prices; and great food (albeit heavy on the meat)".<br />

title: New edition of the Bradt Guide to Macedonia
---

Bradt have recently issued the 2nd edition of their <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841621862">guide to Macedonia</a> - just in time for my visit there, as it happens. The author outlines changes since the first edition on the <a href="http://www.bradtguides.com/details.asp?prodid=105#authorsnotes">Bradt website</a>. A new feature that caught my eye is a chapter dedicated to hiking, with descriptions of twelve walking routes. There are also more details about public transport.<br /><br />The same publisher has also just launched a completely new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841621897"> Zagreb City Guide</a>.

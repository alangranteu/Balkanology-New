title: Lonely Planet updates Romania ... but not Moldova
---

Lonely Planet this month published the fifth edition of their guide to Romania. Previous editions have distinguished themselves from competing guides by including a chapter about the Republic of Moldova, but the newest version covers only Romania. If you are planning to visit Moldova as a side trip you can purchase and download the relevant chapter of LP's Eastern Europe guide from their online shop. Or take a look at LP author Leif Pettersen's <a href="http://romaniaandmoldova.com/">online guide</a>, which still covers both countries.<br />

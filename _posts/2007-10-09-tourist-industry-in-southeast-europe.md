title: The tourist industry in Southeast Europe
---

A recent <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2007/10/08/reportage-01">article</a> in the Southeast European times surveys recent developments in the tourist industry in a number of Balkan countries. In general the article presents a picture of steady growth, albeit from a very low base in the case of Macedonia, which still attracts few foreign visitors.<br /><br />Of course not all the effects of increased tourism are positive. The article points out that residents of Dubrovnik struggle to find a parking space or a reasonably-priced cup of coffee during the summer crush. Meanwhile there are signs that on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, too many hotels have been built too quickly - a problem previously covered in an <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/08/13/feature-01">earlier article</a> on the same website.

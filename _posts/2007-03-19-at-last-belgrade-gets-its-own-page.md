title: At last ... Belgrade gets its own page
---

Due to Belgrade's key location within the transport network of Southeast Europe, I've passed through the city on a number of occasions in my wanderings around the region. I'm always pleased to arrive there, and sorry to leave: Serbia's capital may not be a conventionally beautiful city, but it is one of only a handful of Balkan cities to offer a truly urban experience.<br /><br />Not before time, I have finally got around to creating a <a href="https://balkanology.com/serbia/article_belgrade.html">Belgrade page </a>on Balkanology. I've also expanded the <a href="https://balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html">Vojvodina page</a> to include a number of places that I visited last autumn.

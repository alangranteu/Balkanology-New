This year's round of additions to the UNESCO World Heritage list includes two locations in Southeast Europe.<br /><br />The historic centre of Berat (Berati) in Albania has been added to that of Gjirokastra, which has been listed since 2005. UNESCO describe Berat as an example of a well-preserved Ottoman town that "bears witness to the coexistence of various religious and cultural communities down the centuries".<br /><br />The other addition is the Stari Grad Plain, on the island of Hvar in Croatia, described as "a cultural landscape that has remained practically intact since it was first colonized by Ionian Greeks from Paros in the 4th century BC".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/albania1"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/68495436/small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; width: 160px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/albania1">Berati Photo Gallery</a>

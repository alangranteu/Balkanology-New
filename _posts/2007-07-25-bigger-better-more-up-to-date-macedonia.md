title: Bigger, better, more up to date Macedonia guide
---

Following my trip in May, I have finally got around to updating the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/macedonia/index.html">Macedonia</a> pages in Balkanology. You'll find a new guide to <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/macedonia/article_skopje.html">Skopje </a>and its very interesting surroundings, including Matka Lake and Tetovo. There is also a page about the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/macedonia/article_pelagonia.html">Pelagonia</a>, covering Bitola, Prilep, and Krushevo. And the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/macedonia/article_ohrid.html">Lake Ohrid</a> page has been expanded to cover more excursions around the lake, such as Struga, Vev&#x10d;ani, and Gali&#x10d;ica National Park.

Ryanair this week announced a new route from London Stansted to Zadar, on the central Croatian coast (<a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/news.php?yr=07&amp;month=feb&amp;story=rte-en-060207">news release</a>). There will be three services weekly, starting in April. The airline already flies to Pula in Istria from both Stansted and Dublin.<br /><br />But it's not all relentless expansion in the world of low-cost airlines. Wizzair have announced the cancellation of their London-Ljubljana flights from March onwards.

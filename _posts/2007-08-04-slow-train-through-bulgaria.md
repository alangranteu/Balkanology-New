Regular readers will know that one of my favourite train rides in the Balkans is the narrow-gauge railway from Septemvri to Bansko and Dobrinishte, in the mountains of southwestern Bulgaria. You can find a short description in my page about <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/overview/article_scenicrailways.html">scenic railways in the Balkans</a>.<br /><br />I've just come across a much more detailed account of a journey on this line by <a href="http://ccgi.ajg41.plus.com/bulgarian-narrow-gauge/">Andrew Grantham</a>, who did the trip in June 2006. It's a few years now since I was there myself, so I was glad to read that most things remain the same, including the women in brightly-patterned dresses who get on and off at some of the most remote halts.<br /><br />I hadn't realised until reading this aricle that there was once another narrow-gauge railway connecting Rila monastery with the main Sofia-Thessaloniki line. Apparently it closed in the 1960s. As Andrew says, if it had survived it might now be a popular tourist route.

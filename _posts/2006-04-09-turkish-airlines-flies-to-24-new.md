Turkish airlines has announced flights from Istanbul to <a href="http://www.thy.com/en-INT/corporate/news/announcements/announcement.aspx?did=270">24 new destinations</a>, including Ljubljana, Belgrade, Venice, and Dublin.<br /><br /><div class="imageholder"><img alt="" border="0" height="180" src="https://balkanology.com/blog/images/istanbul2005_pict0030.jpg" width="145" /></div>The last of these touches on a topic particularly close to my heart: getting from Ireland to the Balkans. It seems simple but in practice often turns out to be complicated, expensive, or both. The only direct scheduled flights to the region until now have been to Dubrovnik and Ljubljana - both seasonal services. Alternatives usually seem to involve (a) a painfully early start from Dublin (b) a recklessly tight connection at a hub airport, which you may survive but your bags probably won't, or (c) an overnight stay at an extortionately priced hotel near a London airport. The Istanbul flights on Tuesdays and Fridays are a step in the right direction and the advertised prices seem very reasonable. For some reason it doesn't seem to be possible to book online at the moment - I tried the Turkish Airlines site, Gohop, and EBookers without success. Surely they don't expect us to call an actual real-world travel agency?

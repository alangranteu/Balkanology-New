title: Last train from Italy to Slovenia
---

Rail connections between Italy and neighbouring Slovenia have been progressively reduced over the last few years. The only remaining direct link is the EN440/441 overnight train on the Venice-Ljubljana-Zagreb-Budapest route, which is inconveniently timed for anyone wanting to do the short hop between Venice and Ljubljana.<br />
<br />
Now <a href="http://www.seat61.com/news.htm">The Main in Seat 61</a> reports that even this imperfect connection is to disappear. The last Venice-Budapest night train will apparently run on December 10, 2011.<br />
<br />
Many travellers are likely to give up on rail transport completely as a means of transport between Italy and Slovenia and take a direct bus instead. For those who would still like to do part of the trip by train, the Italy page on the <a href="http://www.slo-zeleznice.si/en/passengers/abroad/italy">Slovenian Railways</a> lists some of the options (by bus from Trieste to Se≈æana; on foot or by taxi from Gorizia to Nova Gorica; and by bus from Triest to Koper).

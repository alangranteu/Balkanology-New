There won't be much activity on Balkanology in April or May, as I will be concentrating on actually travelling instead of writing about travel. But don't worry, I haven't given up on the site, far from it: there will be plenty of new additions to the site over the summer months. <br /><br />I will be visiting Macedonia in May and hope to expand my coverage of that country. Hopefully the weather will be better than it was for my two previous short visits - this time round I'd like to spend less time dodging torrential rainstorms and more time taking photos.<br /><br />Later in 2007 I also hope to add some suggested itineraries for people wishing to take in several Balkan countries in a single trip, and more information about flights to the Balkans from the UK and Ireland.

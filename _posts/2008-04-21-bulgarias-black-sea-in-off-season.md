title: Bulgaria's Black Sea in the off season

A recent <a href="http://www.teletextmedia.co.uk/article.asp?areaID=1&amp;articleID=255&amp;sideNavItemID=65">UK survey</a> named Bulgaria as the best value destination for Britons looking for a cheap break abroad. The Guardian marks the occasion with an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/apr/21/bulgaria">article about a visit to the Black Sea coast</a> in the off season. Not surprisingly, a lot of tourist facilities in Varna and the nearby resorts are closed. That does tend to happen in off-season seaside resorts. At least it gives the writer time to rightly appreciate the wonderfully tomato-ey taste of Bulgarian tomatoes.<br /><br />The article suggests that "with the Euro stronger by the day, the Bulgarian lev looks ever more appealing". As the Bulgarian lev has held its value at about 1.96 to the Euro for many years, this doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. Dodgy economics aside, it's true that that basic costs in Bulgaria remain low by European standards. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center; font-size: 11px;"><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/image/46842737"><img alt="Cathedral of the Assumption, Varna" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/image/46842737/small.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 5px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 160px;" /></a><br />Cathedral of the Assumption, Varna<br /></div>

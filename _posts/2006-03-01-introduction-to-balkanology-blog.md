title: An Introduction to the Balkanology Blog
---

It seems like everyone who has a web site these days feels the need to have a blog as well. I was always a sucker for peer pressure, so I am no exception. I will be using this blog to keep you informed of additions to Balkanology. I'll also mention items of travel news relevant to the Balkans as they come to my attention.

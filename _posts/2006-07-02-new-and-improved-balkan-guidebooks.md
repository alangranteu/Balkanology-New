title: New and improved Balkan guidebooks
---

The guidebook publishers have done quite a lot of juggling of their Southeast European lineup in the last few months. I've updated the Books pages of Balkanology to reflect all the changes mentioned here. (The links below will take you to the relevant page on the Amazon UK site; within Balkanology you will also find links to the corresponding pages on amazon.com).<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting development is the release of the second edition of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1841621498/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Bradt Guide to Albania</a>. Revised versions sometimes amount to little more than window dressing, but that's not the case here. The new edition is 50 pages longer and has quite a lot of new material, particularly about hiking and mountain biking opportunities. Even the maps - never a strong point with Bradt - have been improved. Bradt also plan to issue a second edition of their Bosnia and Herzegovina guide this year, but too late for the summer season - a publication date in November has been mentioned.<br /><br />Over in Serbia, local publishers Komshe have issued the second edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/8686245005/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Serbia in Your Hands</a>. I was pleasantly surprised to find it on sale this week in a shop here in Ireland. It's a very well-produced volume that whets the appetite for exploring the more far-flung corners of Serbia. Don't expect it to have the same level of practical details as the Bradt guide - it tells you about all the places you might want to see but is relatively silent about how to see them. That aside, it's good to see one of the less touristed Balkan countries taking positive steps to encourage travellers. A companion guide to Belgrade is planned for later this year.<br /><br />Back in the world of mainstream publishers (and mainstream destinations), both <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1740597508/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Lonely Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1843536110/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" title="More about this book at Amazon (USA)">Rough Guides</a> have issued the 11th editions of their guides to Greece. Lonely Planet has also launched a seried of "Best of" city guides. These are very slim volumes indeed, aimed very much at the short break market. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1741048591/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Belgrade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1741048230/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Dubrovnik</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/1741048249/ref=nosim/&amp;tag=balkanology-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738" title="More about this book at Amazon (UK)">Ljubljana</a> are all covered.

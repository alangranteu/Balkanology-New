title: The mountains of Montenegro ... and more
---

Now that Montenegro airlines fly directly from Gatwick to Tivat, the country has become more accessible for travellers from the UK. Although the spectacular coastline will inevitably be the focus for many visitors, the country's less touristed inland mountains also deserve attention. A recent <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/destinations/europe/article4479605.ece">article</a> in the Times looks at some of those inland attractions, including the primeval forest of Biogradska Gora. (The accompanying photo was apparently taken in Durmitor National Park, which is not mentioned in the text).<br /><br />Meanwhile in "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/a-touch-of-the-riviera-in-croatia-889535.html">A touch of the Riviera in Croatia</a>" the Independent looks at the two sides of Croatia's Hvar Island - glitzy Hvar town on the south coast, and the more down-to-earth Stari Grad in the north.<br /><br />Venturing further off the beaten path, the Sydney Morning Herald carries an article about <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/europe/albania-comes-alive/2008/08/07/1217702226226.html">Albania</a>.  The author is very enthusiastic about quirky Tirana, but apparently not enthusiastic enough to explore Albania beyond the capital. Even so, it's nice to see Albania appearing in the Australian travel pages - a rare, perhaps even unique event.

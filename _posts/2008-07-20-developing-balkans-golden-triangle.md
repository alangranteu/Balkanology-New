title: Developing the Balkans' Golden Triangle

In today's Independent Sankha Guha <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/dont-mention-the-war-its-time-to-build-on-the-peace-872171.html">reports</a> on an initiative of the United Nations Development Program to encourage cross-border tourism in the former Yugoslavia. The plan is to promote a so-called "Golden Triangle" of World Heritage sites of Dubrovnik (Croatia), Mostar (Bosnia), and Durmitor (Montenegro). <br /><br />It's questionable whether Dubrovnik needs any more publicity, but presumably the plan is to use it to entice tourists to visit the less well-known inland destinations. As the article makes clear, the people behind the plan have some serious problems to overcome: as if it's not bad enough dealing with the legacy of political tensions, they also have to worry about the impression made on visitors by terrifyingly kitsch Tito-era hotels.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/38346313"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/38346313/small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 160px;" /></a><br />Dubrovnik<br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/85621685"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/85621685/small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 107px;" /></a><br />Mostar<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/69299659"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/image/69299659/small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 160px;" /></a><br />Durmitor

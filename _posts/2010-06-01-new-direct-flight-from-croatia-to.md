title: New direct flight from Croatia to Greece
---

Travelling from Croatia to Greece just got (a little bit) easier. Many travellers have been surprised to find that there are no scheduled direct flights between these two countries. That situation has now changed - at least if you happen to be travelling on the right day of the week and at the right time of year. <br />
<br />
Croatia Airlines are now operating a direct flight from Zagreb to Athens three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday). The timetable allows same-day connections via Zagreb to and from other major Croatian destinations such as Split and Zagreb. Currently the route is scheduled to operate until October 3rd.<br />
<br />
The airline says that return fares will be available starting at â‚¬164 - although you will probably need to move fast to snap up a price as low as that any time over the summer months. Don't expect to find cheap one-way fares, budget airline style - as far as I can see a one-way ticket will typically cost just as much as a return. And don't assume that this is the cheapest way to fly from Croatia to Greece - it may work out cheaper to change planes somewhere else, such as Budapest.<br />

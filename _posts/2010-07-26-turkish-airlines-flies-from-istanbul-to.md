title: Turkish Airlines flies from Istanbul to Podgorica

In July 2010 <a href="http://www.thy.com/en-INT/corporate/news/press_room/press_releases/press_release.aspx?pid=5163&amp;utm_source=en-INT&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=Turkish_Airlines_launches_its_first_inaugural_flight_from_Istanbul_to_Podgorica,_Montenegro..._">Turkish Airlines</a> began flying from Istanbul's Ataturk Airport to Podgorica in Montenegro. The flight will operate three times weekly all year round (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday). As well being of interest to local residents, this flight may prove useful to some tourists wishing to travel between the Adriatic coast and Turkey without undertaking the long overland journey. The cheapest one-way fare I could find was €154, while promotional return fares are available for around €190.<br />
<br />
This development means that Turkish Airlines now flies to all capital cities in Southeast Europe.

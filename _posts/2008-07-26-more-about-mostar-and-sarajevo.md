title: More about Mostar and Sarajevo
---

Over the last few weeks I have expanded and updated the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/bosnia/index.html">Bosnia</a> section of the site. The <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/bosnia/article_sarajevo.html">Sarajevo</a> page now includes more pointers to outlying sights such as the Jewish Cemetery, Bukovik Mountain, and Bjelasnica. I have also added a note about Stolac to the <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/bosnia/article_mostar.html">Mostar</a> page.

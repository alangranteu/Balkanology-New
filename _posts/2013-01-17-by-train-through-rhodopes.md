title: By train through the Rhodopes
---

Regular readers of <a href="https://balkanology.com/">Balkanology</a>&nbsp;will know that one of my favourite train journeys in the Balkans is the narrow-gauge line that meanders between the Rhodope, Rila, and Pirin mountain ranges of southwest Bulgaria - see the page on <a href="https://balkanology.com/overview/article_scenicrailways.html">scenic train Journeys in the Balkans</a> for more details. I'm certainly not the only fan of the railway from Septemvri to Bansko and Dobrinishte. A <a href="http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/through-the-rhodopes">recent edition of the Hidden Europe newsletter</a> has an evocative account of the trip. It sounds like the red engine and four green carriages are the same ones I travelled on almost ten years ago ... which reminds me, I really must try to get back there some day soon.<br />

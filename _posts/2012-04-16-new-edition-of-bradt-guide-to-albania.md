title: New edition of the Bradt Guide to Albania
---

Bradt Guides have published the 4th edition of their guide to <a href="http://www.balkanology.com/albania/">Albania</a>. Written by Gillian Gloyer (who was also the author of the previous editions), the guidebook has expanded to 272 pages.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Some of the changes compared to the previous edition reflect the rapid changes in Albania's road network. In particular the new highway to&nbsp;<em style="background-color: white; font-style: normal; line-height: 16px;">KukÃ«s has opened up access to northeast Albania, and the chapter dealing with that part of the country has been reorganised and expanded. The author also mentions the addition of information aimed at the increasing number of visitors who arrive in their own cars or mobile homes.&nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Another new feature is a selection of suggested itineraries for visits to Albania ranging from a few days to a month.</span><br />

title: Summer 2012 closure of the Septemvri-Bansko railway (UPDATED)
---

UPDATE June 24, 2012: it seems that the construction work referred to below has been deferred until 2013, so services on this route will run normally in 2012 ... probably.<br />
<br />
A reader has alerted me to some news about Bulgaria's <a href="https://balkanology.com/overview/article_scenicrailways.html#bulgaria">narrow gauge mountain railway</a> from Septemvri to Bansko and Dobrinishte. It seems that the line will be closed for construction works between June and September 2012, with the trains being replaced by buses for that period.  There are more details (in English) at the <a href="http://mountain-guide-bulgaria.com/?p=2498">Hiking Guide Bulgaria</a> website, which also has other useful information such as the summer opening hours of various gondolas and chair lifts in the Bulgarian mountains.  <br />

The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has <a href="http://www.mia.com.mk/portal/page?_pageid=113,166290&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;VestID=46109350&amp;prikaz=3">announced </a> that Australian citizens will no longer require visas to enter the country. This decision means that Australians, like citizens of the EU, the USA, and Canada, can now travel visa-free throughout the Balkans (except in Turkey, where visas are available on entry).

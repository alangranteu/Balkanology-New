title: The pleasures and pitfalls of driving in Bulgaria
---

If you're considering exploring Bulgaria by car, you'll probably be interested in <a href="http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/holiday_type/driving/article1394266.ece">Driving Bulgaria</a>, an article published in yesterday's Sunday Times.<br /><br />In a pleasant change from the usual press focus on beaches and skiing, the author visits some of the highlights of Bulgaria's southwest, including Rila and Melnik. Although he does have some troubles with poor maps and poorer roads, his overall impression seems to be positive. <br /><br />I can't help wondering if the writer really waited until he was actually on the road in Bulgaria before starting to learn the Cyrillic alphabet. A few hours of advance preparation might have made his first day a lot less stressful - but perhaps it wouldn't have made as good a story.

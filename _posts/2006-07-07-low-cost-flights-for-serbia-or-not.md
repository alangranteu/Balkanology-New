title: Low cost flights for Serbia ... or not?
---

Low cost airlines have taken their time about getting involved in the Balkans, and the market has developed at a much slower rate than in countries such as Poland and Slovakia, but things are changing fast.<br /><br />Or not, if you live in Serbia, which has lagged behind several of its neighbours in this respect. An <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2006/07/03/reportage-01">article </a> in the Southeast European Times this week suggests that things maybe be about to change. Many of the proposed developments seem to still be at a rather theoretical stage, so it remains to be seen whether they will come to fruition. As the article points out, it's not much use being able to fly for 1 dinar if you have a problem getting a visa - which is sadly the case for many Serbians.

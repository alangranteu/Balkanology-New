Until recently the best place to look for bus timetable information for Slovenia was the website of <a href="http://www.ap-ljubljana.si/eng/">Ljubljana Bus Station</a>. However this naturally has the drawback of only including routes that pass through Ljubljana. Information about other routes was scattered in the websites of Slovenia's numerous transport companies.<br /><br />I've recently learned about <a href="http://www.vozni-red.si/">www.vozni-red.si</a>, an initiative of the <a href="http://www.mountainwilderness.si/">Mountain Wilderness </a> organisation to promote public transport. Using data from the Ministry of Transport, the site for the first time brings together the schedules of all domestic bus routes in one place. <br /><br />You can input any two towns to find bus connections between them. Pay attention to the footnotes beneath the schedules as they often contain important information (<i>vozi</i> = runs, <i>ne vozi</i> = does not run, <i>vsak dan</i> = every day, <i>vozi ob delavnikih razen sobote</i> = runs on working days except Saturdays; for more vocabulary including the days of the week see the site's <a href="http://www.vozni-red.si/help.php">help page</a>).<br /><br />A few examples of schedules that previously were quite difficult to find:<br /><a href="http://www.vozni-red.si/bus.php?x=Kranjska+Gora&amp;y=Bovec">Kranjska Gora to Bovec</a> (over the Vr&#x0161;i&#x010d; Pass)<br /><a href="http://www.vozni-red.si/bus.php?x=Bovec&amp;y=Kobarid">Bovec to Kobarid</a> (in the So&#x010d;a Valley)<br /><a href="http://www.vozni-red.si/bus.php?x=Koper&amp;y=Piran">Koper to Piran</a> (along the Adriatic coast)

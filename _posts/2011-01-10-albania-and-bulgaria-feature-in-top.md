title: Albania and Bulgaria feature in top destinations for 2011
---

Two Balkan countries, Albania and Bulgaria, appear in CNN's list of "<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/12/28/top.destinations.2011/index.html">the World's top destinations for 2011</a>". The same two countries features in Lonely Planet's "<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/travel-tips-and-articles/76164">top 10 countries for 2011</a>". (This is not as much of a coincidence as it might appear - a Lonely Planet editor is among the contributors to the CNN list). I am a little bit sceptical about these annual lists - the format normally requires a completely fresh list each year, which means that pretty much every country in the world is likely to get a mention eventually. Even so, it's nice to see the merits of two Balkan destinations being recognised.

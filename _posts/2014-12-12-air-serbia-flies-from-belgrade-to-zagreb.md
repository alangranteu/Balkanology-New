title: Air Serbia flies from Belgrade to Zagreb
---

Today saw the first services on Air Serbia's new route from Belgrade to Zagreb - the first commercial flights between these cities since 1991. Air Serbia plans to operate two return flights daily all year round between the Serbian and Croatian capitals. This should open up new options for travellers from northern Croatia to other Balkan destinations beyond Belgrade itself, with same-day connections possible from Zagreb to cities such as Bucharest, Sofia, and Athens.<br />

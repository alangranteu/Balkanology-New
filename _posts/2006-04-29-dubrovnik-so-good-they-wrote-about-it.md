<div class="imageholder"><img alt="" border="0" height="116" src="http://www.balkanology.com/blog/images/croatia2004_pict4682.jpg" width="180" /></div>The "48 hours in..." series in The Independent regularly explains how to get the most out of a weekend city break. Today's chosen destination is <a href="http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article360791.ece">Dubrovnik.</a> Careful readers of Balkanology's "From the Travel Pages" section may experience a sense of deja vu: the same newspaper told us what to do in <a href="http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article54330.ece">48 hours in Dubrovnik</a> only two years ago. The Indy likes to present itself as a supporter of environmental causes - apparently this extends to the recycling of travel articles.

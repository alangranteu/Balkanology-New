Following yesterday's article on Montenegro, today's Independent features neighbouring Albania. I was a little disappointed to find that the writer of "<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/the-beaches-are-clean-in-albania-and-theyre-almost-empty-847255.html">The beaches are clean in Albania... and they're almost empty!</a>" spent only one night in the country. It seems a rather slim basis for a travel article, but given the general lack of coverage of Albania I suppose it's better than nothing. On the positive side, it seems the author greatly enjoyed his visit to Saranda and Butrint and left wanting to go back.

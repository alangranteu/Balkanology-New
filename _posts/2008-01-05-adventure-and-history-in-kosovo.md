title: Adventure and history in Kosovo
---

It's not difficult to predict that Kosovo will make several appearances in our newspapers over the coming months, as the wrangling over its political future continues. So it's nice to see it appearing in the press for a different reason. Last week USA Today published an article entitled "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2008-01-02-kosovo-adventure-history_N.htm?csp=34">Kosovo offers unspeakable beauty, history and adventure</a>", looking at the region's attractions for travellers.<br /><br />The writer scrupulously describes the Serbian as well as Albanian component of Kosovo's heritage, topping and tailing the article with a description of the Orthodox Decani monastery. With sad inevitability, most of the reader's comments on the article display the kind of one-eyed negativity likely to cause prospective travellers to put off visiting Kosovo for, oh, another 20 years or so.

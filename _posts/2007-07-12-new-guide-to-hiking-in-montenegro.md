title: New guide to hiking in Montenegro
---

Montenegro is potentially a great country for hiking, but up to now it has been frustratingly difficult to get hold of relevant, up to date information in English. So I was very pleased to hear that <a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk">Cicerone</a> have just published a guide to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852845066">The Mountains of Montenegro</a>.<br /><br />The guidebook includes single-day hikes and multi-day treks. Not surprisingly Durmitor National Park features strongly, but the guide also covers ranges that are less well known to foreign visitors, such as Orjen and Prokletije.

title: Belgrade and Thessaloniki, party cities
---

Lonely Planet have listed two Balkan cities among the world's top ten party cities in their new book "1000 ultimate experiences".<br /><br />One of their selections is quite predictable: Belgrade regularly features in lists of this type, thanks to its "varied nightlife, ranging from eclectic watering holes for those in the know, to the busy restaurants and bars of the Skadarlija district and the summer clubs in barges on the Sava and Danube Rivers". <br /><br />The inclusion of Thessaloniki is perhaps more surprising. According to Lonely Planet, Greece's second city offers "great nightlife ... from arty cafes to Latin bars to discos pumping out house music to salacious bouzoukia (clubs featuring twangy, Eastern-flavored Greek folk-pop)".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5AC0NE20091113?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=10522&amp;sp=true">Read the full list</a><br /><br />

Three new cities in Southeast Europe have recently joined the ever-expanding line-up of <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/index.html">In Your Pocket</a> city guides: <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/serbia/city/belgrade.html">Belgrade</a>, <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/slovenia/city/Ljubljana.html">Ljubljana</a>, and <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/greece/city/athens.html">Athens</a>.<br /><br />In fact one of them is not exactly new: many years ago IYP published a guide to Belgrade, on which I relied during my first visit to the city - at that time it was almost the only source of English-language information about Serbia. That turned out to be a once-off edition at the time, so it's great to see IYP giving Belgrade another go. <br /><br />The Ljubljana and Athens guides really are brand-new ventures. All three guides are available online as free downloadable PDF files.

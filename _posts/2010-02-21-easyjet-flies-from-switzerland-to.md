Easyjet has <a href="http://corporate.easyjet.com/media/latest-news/news-year-2010/easyJet%20to%20introduce%20services%20to%20Kosovo%20and%20Isle%20of%20Man.aspx">announced</a> that it will link Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, with two Swiss cities starting in June. Flights from Geneva will operate on Wednesday and Saturday while flights from Basle will leave on Thursday and Saturday. Fares start at 30 euro one way, but you may need to move fast if you want to snap up a flight at that price - especially if you are looking for a Saturday flight in summer.
